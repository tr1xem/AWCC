# AWCC for Dell G series

AWCC is an unofficial alternative to Alienware Command Centre of Windows for the Dell G series on Linux, supporting almost all features that the Windows version supports, including custom fan controls, light effects, g-mode, and autoboost

# Building And Installation

For Arch-Based Distros

```bash
paru -S awcc-git
```

For other Distros, see below.

## Manual Installation

Dependencies:

- `acpi_call-dkms`
- `libusb`
- `pcre2`
- `systemd-libs`
- `glibc`
- `libcap`
- `gcc-libs`
- `git`
- `make`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tr1xem/AWCC
cd  AWCC
sudo make install
```

Make a udev rule for it. (make sure to replace 0551 by 0550 if ur using that)

```bash
# /etc/udev/rules.d/99-awcc.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="187c", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0551", MODE="0660",GROUP="plugdev"

```

Then execute these commands to add urself to plugdev

```bash
 sudo groupadd plugdev
 sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to run it as root, you can use the `awccd` daemon
> that will run it as a user and will not require root privileges
> to run it.

## Keybinding To G-Key

Copy the script from `scripts/main.py` to a desired location and install `evdev` package from pip or aur then run the script with `python3 main.py`. This will make your G-Key and Light Key work as it used to work in Windows.

                          (for testing on unsupported devices)
```

# Device Tested

**Tested on:**

- Dell G15 5530
- Dell G16 7630
- Dell G15 5511

Should work in all Dell G15 models and some G16 models too

Feel free to test and give feedback in [discussions](https://github.com/tr1xem/AWCC/discussions)

# FAQ and TIPS

Q: This works on my device. I want to add it to support officially?

Ans: Yes, you can just run `sudo awcc device-info` and open a discussion with the output
